# Contributing to LangChain

Hi there! Thank you for even being interested in contributing to LangChain.

As an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions, whether they involve new features, improved infrastructure, better documentation, or bug fixes.

To learn how to contribute to LangChain, please follow the [contribution guide here](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/contributing).

## Acceptable uses of LLMs

Generative AI can be a useful tool for contributors, but like any tool should be used with critical thinking and good judgement.

We encourage contributors to use AI tools efficiently where they help. However, AI assistance must be paired with meaningful human intervention, judgement, and contextual understanding. **If the human effort required to create a pull request is less than the effort required for maintainers to review it, that contribution should not be submitted.**

We struggle when contributors' entire work (code changes, documentation updates, pull request descriptions) are LLM-generated. These drive-by contributions often mean well but miss the mark in terms of contextual relevance, accuracy, and quality. Mass automated contributions like these represent a denial-of-service attack on our human effort.

**We will close pull requests and issues that appear to be low-effort, AI-generated spam.**

With great tools comes great responsibility.
